    <div id="About" class="bodyDiv">
        <h1>About Me</h1><p>I am a current student of University of Wisconsin-Madison who has a passion for all things technology. Whether its fiddling with a piece of hardware, setting up a server, or developing an application, I enjoy learning the different nooks and crannies of whatever project is currently being worked on.</p>
            <p>
            Besides development I enjoy spending my time catching up on Star Wars lore, watching the latest news, playing video games, watching anime, or playing piano. These recreational activities amongst others keep life interesting and allow me to see things through a different light.
            </p>
            <p>From a galaxy far far away, to a computer screen much closer, or even to a row of black and white keys, I try to have fun with things and see where a line of thought can take me.</p>

      <h1>Skills and Education</h1>
      <p class='heading'>Education</p>
      <p>I am currently working toward a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Sciences at The University of Wisconsin-Madison. Some significant courses include Introduction to Operating Systems, Introduction to Algorithms, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and Introduction to Computer Graphics.</p>
  <p class='heading'>Programming Languages</p>
  <p>I enjoy learning about and coding in new languages. I started coding with JAVA back in the 8th grade and branched out from there. Now I code in several languages; some very similar to my starting language while others are quite different. Below is a list of the languages I code in</p>
  
  <div style="padding-left:10%;"><ul id="langList">
      <li class ="langLi">OOP Languages<ul><li>JAVA</li><li>C#</li></ul></li>
      <li class ="langLi">Web Programming<ul><li>Javascript</li><li>PHP</li><li>HTML/CSS</li></ul></li>
      <li class ="langLi">Other Languages<ul><li>C</li><li>Python</li><li>Lua</li><li>BASH Shell</li><li>Batch</li></ul></li>

  </div>
  <p style="display:block;" class="heading">Hardware</p>
   <p>In addition to software, I enjoy working with many different types of hardware. I have a basic understanding of electronics coupled with the fundamentals of digital logic. I am also adept at building computers and have a introductory understanding of hardware prototyping/simulation tools</p>
    <p class="heading">Databases and Operating Systems</p>
    <p>I have experience with MySQL and SQL server databases. From managing databases to managing queries, I am able to effectively utilize these two platforms. Similarly to databases, I also am able to manage servers on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. I am able to effectively write code for and administer all three of these systems.  </p>

  <div id="Projects" class="bodyDiv">
  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>I enjoy working on programming activities and love making new things. Here are a few selected projects that I have been working on</p>
  <p class="heading">JAVA Calculator Alpha</p>
  <p>This calculator uses divide and conquer to split up an expression into more manageable sub expressions and eventually return the answer to the input</p>

  <p class="heading">WebGL Cube</p>
  <p>This is a cube made in WebGL which also contains a shader which gives it a rainbow appearance and directional lighting</p>
